# CICT Frontend Docs

Last updated: 2026-05-20

## Purpose

This folder documents the current `cictv4` frontend, especially the public editorial surfaces and the reusable UI patterns behind them. Several older markdown files here started as one-off change logs; they have now been trimmed down into current-state references.

- `/`
- `/news` and `/news/[id]`
- `/announcements` and `/announcements/[id]`
- `/events` and `/events/[id]`
- `/updates`
- `/organization/[id]`
- `/member/[id]`

### Public placeholders or incomplete pages

- `/about`
- `/academics`
- `/admissions`
- `/student-life`
- `/contact`

### Student portal routes

- `/student/login`

## Known active gaps

- The contact page does not yet implement the UI previously described in older docs.
- Footer contact and social links still use placeholder values.
- `refreshToken.ts` targets a backend route that does not exist.
- `auditAPI.ts` exists on the frontend, but there is no matching backend audit route group yet.

## Recommended doc maintenance rule

Prefer documenting current behavior and remaining gaps over keeping long historical change logs. When a file becomes mostly historical, reduce it to a short archival pointer instead of letting it drift away from the code.
