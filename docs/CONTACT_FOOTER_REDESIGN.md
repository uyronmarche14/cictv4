# Contact And Footer Status

Last updated: 2026-05-20

## Current state

The footer redesign is implemented, but the contact page redesign described in the older note is not present in the live code.

Implemented now:
- Footer component at [footer.tsx](/home/ronmarche14/projects/CICT/cictv4/src/components/layout/footer.tsx:1)
- Detail-page CTA block at [DetailPageCTA.tsx](/home/ronmarche14/projects/CICT/cictv4/src/components/sections/DetailPageCTA.tsx:1)
- Detail-page footer block at [DetailPageFooter.tsx](/home/ronmarche14/projects/CICT/cictv4/src/components/sections/DetailPageFooter.tsx:1)

Not implemented now:
- The public `/contact` page is effectively empty aside from metadata at [page.tsx](/home/ronmarche14/projects/CICT/cictv4/src/app/contact/page.tsx:1)
- No contact form submission flow exists in `cictv4`

## Footer implementation

The current footer keeps the bold visual treatment from the older redesign:
- large gradient “LET'S BUILD” headline
- social link row
- decorative blurred background orbs
- college identity and contact strip

Known issues:
- social URLs are placeholders
- phone number is placeholder
- `cict@university.edu` is placeholder content
- the campus location link is `#`

## Recommended next steps

1. Build the actual `/contact` route UI before documenting it as complete.
2. Replace footer placeholder links and contact details with real values.
3. Reuse the CTA visual language for the future contact page instead of creating a separate design system.
